- Heavy computation  
- Anything requiring blocking  

---

## 14. **Why is Node.js quickly gaining attention from Java programmers?**

Node.js is gaining attention because it is a loop-based server for JavaScript. It allows users to write JavaScript on the server, providing access to features like the HTTP stack, file I/O, TCP, and databases.
## 15. **What are the two arguments that `async.queue` takes?**

The two arguments that `async.queue` takes are:

- Task function  
- Concurrency value  

---

## 16. **What is an event loop in Node.js?**

An event loop in Node.js is used to process and handle external events and convert them into callback invocations. During I/O calls, Node.js switches from one request to another, ensuring non-blocking operations.

---

## 17. **Mention the steps to achieve async in Node.js?**

You can achieve async in Node.js through the following steps:

- First-class functions  
- Function composition  
- Callback counters  
- Event loops  

---

## 18. **What are the pros and cons of Node.js?**

### **Pros:**

- If your application doesn’t involve CPU-intensive computation, you can build it entirely in JavaScript, even down to the database level using JSON storage object databases like MongoDB.  
- Crawlers receive a full-rendered HTML response, which is more SEO-friendly compared to single-page applications or websockets apps running on Node.js.  

### **Cons:**

- CPU-intensive computation can block Node.js responsiveness; a threaded platform might be a better choice.  
- Using a relational database with Node.js is less favorable.  

---

## 19. **How does Node.js overcome the problem of blocking I/O operations?**

Node.js solves this problem by utilizing an event-driven model at its core. It uses an event loop instead of threads to handle I/O operations, ensuring non-blocking execution.

---

## 20. **What is the difference between Node.js and Ajax?**

- **Ajax**: A client-side technology used for updating the contents of a webpage without refreshing it.  
- **Node.js**: A server-side JavaScript environment used for building server software. It does not execute in the browser but runs on the server.  

---

## 21. **What are the challenges with Node.js?**

On the technical side, it is challenging in Node.js to scale up a single-threaded process across multi-core servers efficiently.  

---

## 22. **What does “non-blocking” mean in Node.js?**

In Node.js, "non-blocking" refers to its I/O operations being non-blocking. Node.js uses "libuv" to handle I/O operations in a platform-agnostic manner.  

- On Windows: It uses completion ports.  
- On Unix: It uses epoll or kqueue.  

Non-blocking requests are queued in the event loop, which calls the JavaScript callback on the main JavaScript thread when the request is complete.

## 23) What is the command that is used in Node.js to import external libraries?

The command `require` is used to import external libraries in Node.js. For example:

```javascript
var http = require("http");
```

This will load the `http` library and assign the exported object to the `http` variable.

---

## 24) Mention the framework most commonly used in Node.js.

The most commonly used framework in Node.js is **Express**. It is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to build web and mobile applications.

---

## 25) What is a "Callback" in Node.js?

A **callback function** is used in Node.js to handle multiple requests made to the server. For example, if you have a large file that takes time for the server to read, you can use a callback function to allow the server to handle other requests while the file is being processed. The callback function is executed once the task is completed, making Node.js asynchronous and non-blocking.

## Beginner Node.js Interview Questions

### 1. What is Node.js? Where can you use it?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment used to run web applications outside the client’s browser. It is primarily used to create server-side web applications. Node.js is perfect for building data-intensive, real-time applications due to its asynchronous, event-driven architecture.

Some use cases include:
- Real-time web applications
- Network applications
- General-purpose applications
- Distributed systems

### 2. Why use Node.js?

Node.js offers several advantages:
- **Fast performance**: Due to its non-blocking nature.
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Rarely blocks the execution thread.
- **Unified language**: JavaScript for both client-side and server-side code.
- **Asynchronous**: Everything is handled asynchronously, making it scalable.
- **Great concurrency**: Excellent at handling multiple simultaneous connections.

### 3. How does Node.js work?

Node.js operates through the following flow:
1. Clients send requests to the webserver to interact with the application (e.g., query data, delete data, update data).
2. The requests are added to the **Event Queue**.
3. The **Event Loop** processes the requests, handling non-blocking operations first.
4. If a request is simple (non-blocking), it is processed immediately.
5. For complex (blocking) requests, a thread from the **Thread Pool** is assigned to handle the task (e.g., interacting with external resources like a database or file system).
6. Once the task is completed, the response is sent back to the Event Loop and returned to the client.

### 4. Why is Node.js Single-threaded?

Node.js is single-threaded for asynchronous processing. Instead of using multiple threads (like traditional server frameworks), Node.js processes tasks on a single thread, improving performance and scalability, especially under high-load conditions.

### 5. Explain callback in Node.js.

A **callback** is a function that is passed into another function and executed after a task is completed. It allows Node.js to perform asynchronous operations without blocking the event loop. Callbacks help prevent delays in the execution of other requests by allowing other code to run in the meantime.

Node.js APIs are built around callbacks to ensure non-blocking behavior.

### 6. How would you define the term I/O?

**I/O (Input/Output)** refers to any operation or device that transfers data from one medium to another. It includes:
- **Input**: Receiving data from a source (e.g., keyboard, file system, network).
- **Output**: Sending data to a destination (e.g., monitor, file system, network).

In Node.js, I/O operations are typically asynchronous to ensure that other processes can continue while waiting for the I/O operation to complete.
