# Basic ADBMS Concepts

## 1. What is ADBMS?
**A:** ADBMS stands for Advanced Database Management System, which extends traditional DBMS concepts with advanced functionalities like distributed databases, object-oriented databases, data warehousing, and NoSQL databases.

## 2. Differentiate between DBMS and ADBMS.
**A:** DBMS focuses on basic database operations, while ADBMS incorporates advanced features like distributed databases, data replication, and complex data structures.

## 3. What is a distributed database?
**A:** A distributed database is a collection of data stored at different physical locations, which can be accessed and managed as a single logical database.

## 4. What is data fragmentation?
**A:** Data fragmentation is the process of breaking a database into smaller pieces (fragments) to be stored at different locations.

## 5. Explain horizontal and vertical fragmentation.
**A:** 
- **Horizontal Fragmentation:** Splits rows of a table.  
- **Vertical Fragmentation:** Splits columns of a table.

# Normalization and Design

## 6. What is normalization?
**A:** Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

## 7. Define 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.
**A:**
- **1NF:** Removes duplicate columns; each column contains atomic values.  
- **2NF:** Achieves 1NF and removes partial dependencies.  
- **3NF:** Achieves 2NF and removes transitive dependencies.

## 8. What is denormalization?
**A:** Denormalization is the process of adding redundancy to improve database read performance.

## 9. What is a surrogate key?
**A:** A surrogate key is a unique, system-generated identifier used as a primary key.

## 10. Define functional dependency.
**A:** A functional dependency occurs when one attribute uniquely determines another attribute.

# SQL and Query Execution

## 11. Write a query to find the second-highest salary from a table.
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee);
```

## 12. What is the difference between HAVING and WHERE?
**A:** 
- **WHERE:** Filters rows before grouping.  
- **HAVING:** Filters groups after grouping.

## 13. What is a self-join?
**A:** A self-join is a join where a table is joined with itself.

## 14. How do you create a view in SQL?
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 
FROM table_name;
```

## 15. What are indexes in SQL?
**A:** Indexes are database structures that improve the speed of data retrieval.

# Transactions and Concurrency

## 16. What is a transaction?
**A:** A transaction is a sequence of database operations executed as a single logical unit.

## 17. Explain ACID properties.
**A:** 
- **Atomicity:** Transactions are all-or-nothing.  
- **Consistency:** Transactions bring the database from one valid state to another.  
- **Isolation:** Transactions do not interfere with each other.  
- **Durability:** Committed transactions are permanent.

## 18. What is a deadlock?
**A:** A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions are waiting for each otherâ€™s resources indefinitely.

## 19. Explain the two-phase locking protocol.
**A:** It ensures serializability by having two phases:
- **Growing Phase:** Locks are acquired.  
- **Shrinking Phase:** Locks are released.

## 20. What is a dirty read?
**A:** A dirty read occurs when a transaction reads uncommitted data from another transaction.

# Advanced SQL

## 21. Write a query to find employees who earn more than the average salary.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee);
```

## 22. What is the purpose of GROUP BY?
**A:** GROUP BY groups rows sharing a property and allows aggregate functions like SUM, AVG, etc.

## 23. Differentiate between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN.
**A:** 
- **INNER JOIN:** Returns matching rows.  
- **OUTER JOIN:** Includes unmatched rows with NULL values.

## 24. What is a trigger in SQL?
**A:** A trigger is a stored procedure that automatically executes in response to certain events.

## 25. What is a stored procedure?
**A:** A stored procedure is a precompiled set of SQL statements stored in the database.

# PL/SQL and Programming

## 26. What is the difference between a procedure and a function in PL/SQL?
**A:** A procedure does not return a value, while a function returns a value.

## 27. Write a PL/SQL block to display employee details.
```plsql
BEGIN
  FOR rec IN (SELECT * FROM employee) LOOP
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(rec.emp_name || ' - ' || rec.salary);
  END LOOP;
END;
```

## 28. What is an exception in PL/SQL?
**A:** An exception is an error condition in PL/SQL that can be handled using exception-handling blocks.

## 29. Explain the MERGE statement.
**A:** The MERGE statement performs INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations based on a condition.

## 30. What is a cursor in PL/SQL?
**A:** A cursor is a pointer to a result set of a query.

---

# NoSQL and New Technologies

## 31. What is NoSQL?
**A:** NoSQL refers to non-relational databases designed for scalability and unstructured data.

## 32. Name some types of NoSQL databases.
**A:** 
- Document-based (e.g., MongoDB)  
- Key-value (e.g., Redis)  
- Column-family (e.g., Cassandra)  
- Graph (e.g., Neo4j).
